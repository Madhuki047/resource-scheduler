# Scheduling System for a Shared Resource (In Progress)

This project implements a booking and scheduling system for a shared resource (such as a meeting room or piece of equipment).
It ensures that no conflicting reservations occur and demonstrates the use of algorithmic thinking and object-oriented design.

The system allows users to create, view, and manage bookings, while automatically detecting and preventing overlapping time intervals.

## Features
- Object-oriented models for Users, Bookings, and Resources
- Conflict detection using time-interval overlap algorithms
- Support for multiple search methods (linear, binary)
- Sorted booking lists for efficient scheduling
- Simple GUI or console interface for demonstration
- Extensible design suitable for academic evaluation

## Project Structure
- 'scr/models' - Core data classes
- 'src/algorithms' - Optimization strategies
- 'src/utils' - Helper functions
- 'data/' - Example datasets
- 'tests/' - Unit tests
